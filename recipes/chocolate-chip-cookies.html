    <p>
        This is recipe isn't special. I googled this stupid recipe and just picked one the billions of other identical recipes.
        They're cookies boys and girls, nothing special than flour, butter, vanilla extract, chocolate chips, etc. You know how cookies
        work; I don't have to explain cookies to you!
